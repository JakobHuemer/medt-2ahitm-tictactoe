# medt-2ahitm-tictactoe

This is a simple static Minecraft Themed TicTacToe.

The concept is based on real Minecraft mechanics where sticky pistons
can both push and pull blocks based on the power timings.

This build is possible in actual Minecraft with observers powering the
pistons from below.

The snapping of the pistons is minecraft accurate and it does this in order
to push a block and not pull it back.
